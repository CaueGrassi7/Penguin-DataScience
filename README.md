# Penguin Data Science

This project compares two different classification methods, **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** and **Decision Rules**, using the `palmerpenguins` dataset. The goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of these methods in predicting the species of penguins based on their physical characteristics.

## Overview

The project includes an analysis of the dataset's structure, data cleaning to handle missing values, and the implementation of two classification methods:

- **Decision Rules:** A straightforward approach using basic rules based on penguin body mass and flipper length.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** A more sophisticated algorithm that considers multiple features to classify each penguin.

The accuracy of each method is calculated and compared to determine which method is more effective for this dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the `palmerpenguins` dataset, which provides various measurements of three different penguin species: Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo. The dataset is widely used for educational purposes and provides a great opportunity to practice data analysis and machine learning.
